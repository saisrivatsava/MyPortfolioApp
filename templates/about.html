                    Hi. My name is Sai Sri Vatsava, and I build amazing things.
                </p>
                <a href="#FAQ" class="primary-btn text-uppercase">More About Me</a>
            </div>


            <div class="col-lg-12 pt-60">
                <p>Nine months ago I was in a new city at a dead end job. After some serious self-reflection about my passions and interests, I committed to learning everything I could about machine learning, data science, and the tech industry. I built my own curriculum, a hodgepodge of hundreds of websites and forums, and committed between 4-6 hours each day to learn the basics.</p><p>

Fast forward to today where I have enrolled in an excellent computer science program. I now publish my own blog posts to help others learn about everything from data science to deep learning. I am excited by all the things I have learned over the last few months, and I love that I get to work on something I am passionate about each day.</p><p>

However, I still have a long way to go. The next few months I will focus on teaching others and implementing machine learning models in real world production systems. I further hope to get internship experience so I can engage with other like-minded people and get more experience building intelligent systems for use in the real-world.</p>

                                I created and deployed this website on a private <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> server so that I could learn more about web app design and back-end development. I believe that knowledge of <b>both data science and back-end development</b> is the secret to seamless implementation of artificial intelligence in existing web technologies.</p>

<p> In the future I will use this website as a nesting ground for web-based computer vision and NLP models. Though I don't expect it to be anything more than a portfolio site, I strongly suspect that these skills will be crucial to technological development in the years to come.</p>

                            <p>I discovered machine learning a year ago after graduating from Baylor University. Since then I have immersed myself in data science communities on <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and across the web.</p>

                            <p>I have pushed myself to not only understand the theory behind machine learning, but also the constraints that productionizing artificial intelligence entails.</p>

                            <p>By renting servers from DigitalOcean, GCP, and AWS I have been able to develop my own back end production environment. I believe that data scientists who can own every step of the ML lifecycle will be invaluable in the coming years..</p>

                                <p>I am curious by nature. Machine learning and computer vision are both excellent tools to understand the world better. </p>
                            <p>Despite the movement towards integrating AI into existing technologies, the implementation of machine learning (especially computer vision) is still in its infancy.

                            <p>I am very interested in web application development. I think the best fit for me will be a career in the tech industry.</p>

                            <p> I am drawn towards the industry's focus on rapid improvement, innovation, and team-oriented creativity. Furthermore, I think when it comes to improving existing technologies there is a great deal of low-hanging fruit to be reached thanks to the movement towards microservice architecture and docker containerization. These developments make machine learning more integrable than ever.</p>
